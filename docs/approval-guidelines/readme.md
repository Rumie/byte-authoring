# Approval Guidelines

## Acknowledgement

Rumie is a learning technology nonprofit organization, located in Toronto, Canada, that facilitates the authoring and free dissemination of microlearning courses called Bytes. Rumie provides the tools and a platform for volunteers to build Bytes covering a broad range of topics, based on their skills and expertise. We acknowledge the inherent cultural, linguistic, and geographic biases present in our own organization and core author community. As a small organization, we try our best to guide contributions that are culturally sensitive and aware.

## Standards

Rumie will not post authored content that:

1. may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal;
2. may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property;
3. seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise;
4. may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort;
5. contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;
6. contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party's trade secrets);
7. contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or
8. contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current.
9. may not publish or post other people's private information (such as home phone number and address) without their express authorization and permission.
10. may not violate others' intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark.

### Partner Content Creator Standards
- The purpose of Bytes is to support learning and share expertise, not promote a product or political viewpoint.
- Within the body of the Byte, Partnerâ€™s are permitted to include one external link to the organization where it is relevant to the content itself or in the "Take Action Step" to link to additional resources.
- Partners are not permitted to direct learners to a product or service that they are selling as this compromises the integrity of the content.
- Partners may never put their Byte content behind a paywall.


## Proofing

Before publishing any Bytes publicly, Rumie reviews Bytes for the following elements:

- Correct spelling and grammar (following American conventions)
- Appropriate formatting
- Sufficient attribution (facts and external imagery are accompanied by a source as needed)
- Appropriate categorization under related category/topic/theme
- Appropriate timing selection (3/6/9 min)

## Title Conventions

Choose one of the following formats to title your Byte:
- A question. Mimic a search query. _How do I pick a college?_
- Learn to X in # min. _Learn to meditate in 3 min_
- [Number of] ways to X. _3 ways to proof your resume_
- [Number of] reasons to X. _4 reasons to use SCRUM on your next project_
