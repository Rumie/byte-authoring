# Rumie ByteGuide: Byte Authoring Essentials

Created by Manav Chugh on Sep 17, 2020 The Rumie Initiative

There are 4 key stages of the Byte Building process.

## 1. Familiarize Yourself With Byte Basics

### About Bytes

- Bytes are **microlearning experiences**, less than 10 minutes long
- Each Byte has one learning objective
- Bytes focus on **applying the concept** in a real-world context

### Content Guidelines

We create Bytes primarily on soft life and career skills that orient on the action. **Soft skills** are non-technical abilities that relate to how we work and interact with others. _For example: teamwork, communication, and adaptability._

## 2. Author a Learning Objective (LO)

_Training Session_ [<u>recording</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gssAXr12iY),[<u>deck</u>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WcLQcp_Y0sc4J20KfFBYbePwLSNWM3O5NIMgsmmJoJQ/edit?usp=sharing), and [<u>activity</u>](https://mm.tt/1619674632?t=Y8KOz8cd0L).

#### LO Purpose

- LOs help _learners_ self identify appropriate content. It helps answer the question: will this be helpful to me? Is this the outcome I'm looking for?
- LOs help _Byte authors_ maintain focus, ensuring that all content is directly contributing to or 'laddering up' to the learning objective.

#### Authoring Effective LOs

1. Confirm: _does it align with Rumie's_ [<u>content guidelines</u>]_?_
2. _Confirm: does it add something new to the Byte library?_

- Use keywords to search the existing Byte library on Rumie-Learn and objectives in ClickUp to confirm your idea is not duplicative.
- Your objective should add something unique or complement existing Bytes.

3. _Start the sentence with a Bloom's Taxonomy verb._

- If possible, aim for the "application" level.
- This anchors the content on an _observable action_ and avoids being just an information dump.

4. _Ensure it's Byte sized._

- Because Bytes are short learning bursts, we'll often break down a learning objective into multiple, smaller chunks.
- While it's possible to deliver a Byte that has a high-level overview of a complex topic, it won't allow you to go in detail with specific elements. <br>
  _Example In Action_

_There is one Byte that overviews "SMART Goals," and also 5 individual Bytes that go into each of the letters in greater detail._

- Use a mind map to breakdown your objective into sub-components. If you can create three or more layers of branching, choose one of the lower branches to create an attainable and appropriately sized objective.

5. _Keep the language simple._

- Just like the content in Bytes themselves, we want to learn objectives to be clear and direct. Ask yourself: Would an 8th grader understand it?

## 3. Build Your Byte in Rumie-Build

### Apply Effective Learning Strategies

#### Hook the Learner

- Use the Background Info section to pull learners in and pique their interest.
- Ask a provocative question, use a scenario, or share an impactful statistic.

#### Examples, examples, examples!

- Bytes are about tangible application, not theory.
- If you share an idea or concept, back it up with how it actually plays out in real life.
- Use multiple examples, include them as content steps, add them as multiple choice questions, make them into scenarios.

#### Quiz Questions
_Training Session_ [<u>recording</u>](https://youtu.be/fxkJs3nVwjQ), and[<u>deck</u>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FNf_xfquUQPzINe1yYUHTvOOtpEKxAw74zDFB3Sxwfs/edit?usp=sharing).

- The best multiple-choice questions nudge learners to make an active decision and apply their learning, not just recall information.
  - One way to do this is to present a brief scenario or example that has not already been shared. In the example, have the learner identify the next course of action, or how a situation could be handled better, etc.
- Try to make answers a similar length (otherwise, learners will usually guess the longest one)
- Try to make distractor answers plausible. Answers that are obviously wrong make the question too easy. Make all options somewhat tempting.


#### Strong Takeaway Prompts

In the final "Take Action" step of your Byte, give the learner a prompt for something they can do immediately to apply their learning. This gives them the opportunity to extend their learning. Think of it almost like you're assigning some light homework.


### Apply Best Practices for Byte Writing Style

Terminology

- Write directly to our learners, it makes the tone warm and friendly. Use terms like "you," "our," and "we."
- When referring to a generic person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant to the context, use the singular "they" instead of "he/she."
- Try to keep your examples as **location agnostic** as possible. Choose examples and terminology with wide applicability.<br>
  For example:
  - Say 'market' instead of 'grocery store'
  - Reference a 'coworker' but don't make a scenario explicitly in an office environment
  - Be cautious of mentioning something that might be culturally taboo (i.e. protesting, adultery, etc.)

## 4. Engage in the Peer Review Process

_Training Session_ [<u>recording</u>](https://youtu.be/p4h4ibUFhVo)_, and_ [<u>deck</u>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Bc2_E52BP5NtBx9TVBe9XYpJIcGG_rSsqB-CfFmlz7A/edit?usp=sharing)

Rumie encourages all Byte authors to get peer review feedback from at least 2 other people.

_Consider these points as you complete a peer review of a Byte._

|                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Learning Effectiveness** | _ Does the Byte fulfill the stated objective? <br> _ Is the content ordered in a logical way? (I.e. big picture before supporting details?)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Writing**                | _ Is the language simple and approachable? (Can I remove any jargon?) <br> _ Is the language action-oriented (i.e. "Do this" vs. "One would do this")? <br> _ Is the writing concise and direct (is there any filler that can be removed without compromising the message?) <br> _ Does the writing flow well from one point to the next? (Do transitions smoothly connect the points?)<br>                                                                                                            |
| **Format**                 | _ Does the formatting look clean and consistent? <br> _ Does the imagery complement the writing? <br> \* Is this learning experience shorter than 10 minutes? _(i.e. When I read it through to digest the information, watch all media, and engage with questions, the total seat time should be ~10 minutes or less. **Consider your reading speed in this assessment. If you're a slow reader, allow yourself ~15 minutes per Byte. If you're a fast reader, allow yourself ~5 minutes per Byte.**)_ |
| **Engagement**             | _ Is there at least one multiple-choice question? <br> _ Does it require the learner to apply their learning? (vs. simple recall/memorization) <br> \* Is there at least one instance of audio or video?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

After gathering peer review feedback, Byte authors should finesse and finalize their Byte based on these insights. 

## 5. Submit Byte for Rumie Review

After the Byte is complete prepare it for publishing by clicking "Byte for Rumie Review" in Build. 
At this stage, authors:
- Choose a cover photo
- Can retitle their Byte
- Add any metadata tags (e.g. essential video, polarizing content)

The Byte will then undergo Rumie's review and approval process.
