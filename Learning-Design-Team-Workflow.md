# Learning Design Team Workflow

## Team Structure

* The Learning Design Team is broken down into squads.
* Each squad has a lead who is the first point of contact for troubleshooting and answering questions for team members.
* Squad leads are responsible for assigning peer reviewers within the squad each sprint.
* Squads will be shuffled every few months.

## Sprints

The Learning Design team follows a 14-day sprint structure, outlined below.

* Sprint content areas will be communicated via Slack prior to the start of each sprint.
* The sprint is a guide but not hard deadlines. If you are delayed or need more time, communicate this with your squad lead via slack.
Occasionally, we will take a week between sprints as a "Catch-Up and Learning Objectives" week.
* This week is intended as an opportunity for all team members to tie up any outstanding loose ends, author, and review learning objectives on the topic of focus. <br>

## Rumie-Build

* Bytes are built-in Rumie-Build.
* Upon completion of onboarding, Learning Designers will be emailed a link to access Rumie-Build.
  - The first time Learning Designers access the link, they will be prompted to create a profile. This includes an avatar, fun facts, as well as opportunities to add a bio and link externally to their online presence.
  - Learning Designers will use the same link to build all of their Bytes.
  - Rumie-Build will keep you automatically logged in at the end of your session. (Don't click "Log Out" unless you are on a public computer.)

## ClickUp

* Byte status' are tracked in ClickUp.
* Upon completion of onboarding, Learning Designers will receive an invitation to join ClickUp. 
  - Unfortunately, this will come as multiple emails for each of the content topics. Fortunately, it only happens once!

### Statuses

As you move through the sprint process (authoring, peer review, and revision,) you will update the status of your Byte in ClickUp. The statuses are:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Objective Idea | * This is your objective 'brainstorm.' It may not be fully formed yet. <br> * Change status when you are satisfied with the objective and have checked it against the [<u>guidelines.</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S9ceZKlI7ODSk-SCnVW022ErcSoJWgUdwVGrKNhjWSo/edit#heading=h.e6bgk9la8ngz) <br> |
| The objective for Peer Review | * This is an objective that is ready for the second set of eyes. <br> * Reviewers, consider the objective in the context of the [<u>guidelines</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S9ceZKlI7ODSk-SCnVW022ErcSoJWgUdwVGrKNhjWSo/edit#heading=h.e6bgk9la8ngz). <br> * Make changes directly to the LO, or @tag the author with comments. <br> * Once the reviewer 'blesses' the objective, the reviewer changes the status. <br> |
| Ready to Build | * This is an objective that has been peer-reviewed and is ready to be built into a Byte. <br> * Ready to Build objectives are considered 'up for grabs' until/unless someone has claimed it by making themself the 'assignee.' <br> * Once you claim an objective (by making yourself the "assignee" at the start of a sprint), change the status. <br> |
| Build-in Progress | * This indicates that you are currently working on your first draft of the Byte. <br> * Add the Byte URL from Rumie-Build. <br> * Change the status when you have completed your first draft of the Byte (at the end of week 1 of the sprint). <br>|
| Byte for Peer Review | * This indicates that the Byte draft is complete and ready for peer review. <br> * Peer reviewers may review in any order using the [<u>Peer Review Checklist</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S9ceZKlI7ODSk-SCnVW022ErcSoJWgUdwVGrKNhjWSo/edit#heading=h.381elfqk3uxf). <br> * Peer reviewers make comments either by commenting on the task within ClickUp or by leaving comments directly in the Byte using the comments feature. <br> * After giving comments, the first person to peer review changes the status. |
| Byte for Peer Review 2 | * This indicates that the Byte draft has received one set of peer review comments. <br> * Peer reviewers may review in any order using the [<u>Peer Review Checklist</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S9ceZKlI7ODSk-SCnVW022ErcSoJWgUdwVGrKNhjWSo/edit#heading=h.381elfqk3uxf). <br> * Peer reviewers make comments either by commenting on the task within ClickUp or by leaving comments directly in the Byte using the comments feature. <br> * After giving comments, the second person to peer review changes the status. <br> |
| Revisions in Progress | * This indicates that you are incorporating peer review feedback to finalize your Byte. <br> * After finalizing, click "Publish" in Rumie Build. - Select a cover photo - Retitle the Byte (using Title Case) - Categorize according to category/topic/theme - Select appropriate timing <br> * Change the Byte status after publishing. <br> |
| Byte for Rumie Review | * This indicates that the Byte is ready for Rumie review/approval. <br> * Rumie will review the Byte in correspondence with the [<u>Approval Guidelines.</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S9ceZKlI7ODSk-SCnVW022ErcSoJWgUdwVGrKNhjWSo/edit#heading=h.giyd5nuwn271) <br> * Rumie will change the status after approving the Byte. <br> |
| Byte Published | * This indicates that the Byte is live on Rumie-Learn. <br> |

### Dashboards
